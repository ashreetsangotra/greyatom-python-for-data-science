### Project Overview

 The main objective was to go through a census data, while trying to draw conclusions about the population and govermnment policy implementation.


### Learnings from the project

 I learnt a jist of numpy library, its various features and commands


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Initially the approach was to just formulate algorithms to solve the problem. But with more understanding of numpy, I started researching for in built numpy functions and its usage, thus making the code more cleaner and at times, also faster. 


### Challenges faced

 The main challenge was the time consumed, as i had to research different fuctions to solve the problem at hand. But after going through this process, I am now more familiar with the numpy library.


### Additional pointers

 First of many projects to learn Numpy and Data Science.
